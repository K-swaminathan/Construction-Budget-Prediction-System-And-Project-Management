# Construction Project Management System with Budget Prediction

## Overview

This project is a Construction Project Management System integrated with machine learning-based budget prediction. It streamlines project workflows, improves resource management, and enhances budget control. The system handles task scheduling, resource allocation, and progress tracking, while ML models predict project costs and identify potential budget overruns. Additionally, it provides data-driven reports and visualizations for cost optimization and risk management.

## Features

- **Project Management Dashboard**: Centralized task scheduling, resource allocation, and progress tracking.
- **ML-Based Budget Prediction**: Predict project costs using historical data, material prices, and labor costs.
- **Cost Overrun Alerts**: Identify and notify potential budget overruns.
- **Data-Driven Reporting**: Generate reports and visualizations for performance tracking and cost optimization.
- **Risk Management**: Insights and recommendations to mitigate financial risks.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python, Flask/Django
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Database**: MySQL/PostgreSQL
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
